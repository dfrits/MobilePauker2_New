    This App was developed as a part of my Master Thesis in 2018 and then redesigned at my study
    abroad. Its purpose is to enable easy cross-platform-learning with flash cards.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="http://pauker.sourceforge.net/">Pauker</a> is a text based flash card application.
    It uses a combination of ultra-short term, short term, and long term memory. <br>
    <b>Mobile Pauker++</b> is an Android version of <b>Pauker</b> and compatible with <b>version
    1.7</b> and above.
</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>It is very easy to use. You have the choice to</p>
<ul>
    <li>add immediately cards and then save the Lesson,</li>
    <li>associate the App with your
        <a href="http://market.android.com/details?id=com.dropbox.android">Dropbox</a> account.
        Dropbox creates a folder at your account at "Apps" called "Mobile Pauker++". Then just save
        your lesson on your PC in this folder and synchronise them or
    </li>
    <li>
        download a lesson from the official website of Pauker. (It's not neccesary to look for the
        App
        folder. Just open the lesson in the browser.)
    </li>
</ul>
